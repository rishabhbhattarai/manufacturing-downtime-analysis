# Wolf Cola Production Line Efficiency Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project analyzes bottling line productivity and downtime data for **Wolf Cola**, a soft drink manufacturer based in Philadelphia.  
The goal was to evaluate **line efficiency**, identify **key downtime drivers**, and propose data-driven **operational improvements**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Calculate Line Efficiency**  
   - Determine efficiency by operator using batch time and standard minimum batch time.
2. **Identify Main Downtime Factors**  
   - Apply a Pareto chart to highlight the top contributors to production downtime.
3. **Analyze Downtime by Operator and Factor**  
   - Build a matrix to reveal operator-specific downtime patterns.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Overall line efficiency: **64%**
- Top 5 downtime causes = **80%** of total downtime
- **Mac** showed the lowest efficiency and high batch-change downtime
- Majority of downtime was due to **operator-related issues**

---

## ðŸ§© Recommendations
1. Conduct **machine adjustment training** for all operators  
2. Provide **batch change retraining** for Mac  
3. Introduce **preventive maintenance** for critical machines
